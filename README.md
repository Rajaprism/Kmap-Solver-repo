# Kmap-Solver-repo


    Objective
    The objective of this is assignment is to write an algorithm in python that takes two list func_TRUE and func_DC as argument and returned a list           containing terms of expanded regions having minimum possible literal counts covering all valid regions and it doesnâ€™t contain those terms whose             corresponding K-map regions are fully contained within one or more other terms/regions.
